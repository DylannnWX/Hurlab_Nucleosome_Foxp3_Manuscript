Hi there,

This python script utilizes the FIMO search results of Foxp3 PD-seq peaks. In addition, it filters out certain non-Foxp3-binding patterns in search results:

12A, 12G, 12T, 12C, 6AG, 6AT, 6AC, 6GT, 6GC, and 6TCs

Only FIMO regions with p-value lower than 8e-5 were saved. The result datasheet was exported into a tab-delimited bed file, with the first three columns being Chromosome, Start and End. This result file can be used directly with bedtools peak overlap and filtering.

You can also use your own FIMO tsv outputs for this python script.
